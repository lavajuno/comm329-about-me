                    <strong>My name is Juno,</strong>
                    <p>
                        I am a senior in computer science at Clarkson University.
                        I was born and raised in central Massachusetts, where I played in my
                        high school's marching band, ran cross country, and was on the
                        local FIRST robotics team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest in computers started in
                        middle school when I wanted to learn how to run a Minecraft
                        server. I ended up programming for my high school's robotics
                        team for a couple years before choosing to come to Clarkson.

                        My time at Clarkson has been jam packed. I ran a show at our
                        radio station for a while, and joined a bunch of clubs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, I help run the Clarkson Open Source Institute, the
                        amateur radio club, and the gender/sexuality alliance. While at
                        Clarkson, I have done some web development for the CS labs, as
                        well as a couple personal projects. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Summer 2024, I started working for Mission Sun, a startup designing
                        utility-scale transformers and solar inverters. At Mission Sun, I do
                        a lot of full-stack development, specifically for our parts database
                        and manufacturing systems. I also write plugins for our ERP system
                        to help us manage our inventory and manufacturing line.

                    I chose to take this course as part of my new IT minor, and also
                    because of my personal interest in the subject. As the
                    continuation of Principles of UX Design, I hope that it will
                    help me design powerful and intuitive software down the road.
                    As a standalone frontend development course, I hope that it will
                    help me pick up and develop new and existing skills to create
                    full-featured applications.
