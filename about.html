                <strong>My name is Juno,</strong>
                I am a senior in computer science at Clarkson University. I was
                born and raised in central Massachusetts, where I played in my
                high school's marching band, ran cross country, and was on the
                local FIRST robotics team.

                My interest in computers started in
                middle school when I wanted to learn how to run a Minecraft
                server. I ended up programming for my high school's robotics
                team for a couple years before choosing to come to Clarkson.

                My time at Clarkson has been jam packed. I ran a show at our
                radio station for a while, and joined a bunch of clubs.
                Nowadays, I help run the Clarkson Open Source Institute, the
                amateur radio club, and the gender/sexuality alliance. While at
                Clarkson, I have done some web development for the CS labs, as
                well as a couple personal projects. This summer, I started
                working for Mission Sun, a startup designing utility-scale solar
                inverters. At Mission Sun, I do a lot of full-stack development,
                specifically for our parts database and manufacturing systems.
                I also write plugins for our ERP system to help us manage our
                inventory and manufacturing line.

                I chose to take this course as part of my new IT minor, and also
                because of my personal interest in the subject. As the
                continuation of Principles of UX Design, I hope that it will
                help me design powerful and intuitive software down the road.
                As a standalone frontend development course, I hope that it will
                help me pick up and develop new and existing skills to create
                full-featured applications.
